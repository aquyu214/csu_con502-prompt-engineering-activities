  <h1>Demo – Chain-of-Thought (MCDM)</h1>

  <p>
    Below is the scenario for this activity. Read it first, then 
  copy and run the <strong>Standard Prompt</strong> in a generative AI tool. 
  After that, copy and run the <strong>Chain-of-Thought Prompt</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Scenario:</strong><br>
    A municipal civil project is behind schedule. The Project Manager has identified two options for the next phase (tunneling):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Option X:</strong> Uses a new, unproven safety technology that saves 6 weeks but has a
      1% chance of temporary toxic gas release (low public risk).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Option Y:</strong> Uses standard, slower technology (takes 6 weeks longer) but is
      100% safe for the surrounding community.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The contract includes a <strong>$500,000 liquidated damages</strong> penalty if the deadline is missed.
  </p>

Which option should the Project Manager choose and why?

  <h2>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompt</h2>
  <textarea readonly id="cotPrompt">
A municipal civil project is behind schedule. The Project Manager has identified two options for the next phase (tunneling):

Option X: Uses a new, unproven safety technology that saves 6 weeks but has a 1% chance of temporary toxic gas release (low public risk).

Option Y: Uses standard, slower technology (takes 6 weeks longer) but is 100% safe for the surrounding community. The contract has a $500,000 liquidated damages penalty if the deadline is missed.

Analyze the dilemma using a research framework. Let's think step by step:
1. Identify the Stakeholders (Client, Contractor, Community, Safety Regulator).
2. List the primary Goal/Constraint of each stakeholder (e.g., Client: Schedule/Cost; Regulator: Zero Risk).
3. Apply the Precautionary Principle (Civil/Environmental Ethics).
4. Use a Weighted Matrix to justify a final recommendation, prioritizing Public Safety over Financial Penalty.
5. Formulate a final decision and a communication strategy for the client.
