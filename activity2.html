FEW-SHOT EXAMPLE (using a published MT study)
------------------------------------------

Abstract (Example):
Mass timber construction (MTC) has emerged as a sustainable alternative to conventional 
building systems due to its low carbon footprint, high structural performance, 
and alignment with the principles of a circular economy. While the environmental 
and structural advantages of mass timber (MT) are well-documented, its occupational 
safety implications remain underexplored. This study examines how construction safety 
professionals in the United States perceive and experience safety in MT projects, and 
how these perceptions compare to those in conventional concrete and steel construction. 
To achieve this objective, the data were collected through a national web-based survey 
of OSHA-authorized construction safety trainers. Analyses were conducted to explore 
perceptions of occupational safety in MT projects, to compare safety perceptions 
between MT and conventional materials, and to identify construction hazards and challenges 
specific to MT construction. Results show that respondents with MT experience generally 
perceive MT projects as safer than concrete or steel, whereas those without experience 
tend to be more neutral. However, even among experienced safety professionals in MT, 
a gap persists between observed and perceived safety hazards. High rates of near misses 
and non-fatal injuries further indicate operational strain during MT erection. These 
findings underscore the need for specialized, data-driven safety training and planning 
frameworks tailored to MT's distinct workflows. Targeted safety programs can help align 
perception with reality, thereby improving safety outcomes in this rapidly expanding 
sustainable construction sector.

Structured Summary (Example):

- Research Problem:
  Occupational safety risks in mass timber construction are not well understood,
  especially compared to conventional concrete and steel construction.

- Methods Used:
  A national web-based survey of OSHA-authorized construction safety trainers;
  analyses conducted to explore safety perceptions in MT projects, compare MT to
  conventional materials, and identify hazards and challenges specific to MT.

- Project Context / Setting:
  Mass timber construction projects in the United States, as perceived by
  construction safety professionals.

- Key Findings:
  Respondents with MT experience generally perceive MT projects as safer than
  concrete or steel, whereas those without MT experience tend to be more neutral.
  Even among experienced professionals, a gap persists between observed and
  perceived safety hazards, and high rates of near misses and non-fatal injuries
  indicate operational strain during MT erection.

- Practical Implications for Construction Management:
  Specialized, data-driven safety training and planning frameworks tailored to MT's
  distinct workflows are needed to align safety perceptions with actual hazards and
  improve safety outcomes in this expanding sustainable construction sector.
