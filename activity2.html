FEW-SHOT EXAMPLE (using a published MT study)
------------------------------------------

Abstract (Example):
Mass timber construction (MTC) has emerged as a sustainable alternative to conventional 
building systems due to its low carbon footprint, high structural performance, 
and alignment with the principles of a circular economy. While the environmental 
and structural advantages of mass timber (MT) are well-documented, its occupational 
safety implications remain underexplored. This study examines how construction safety 
professionals in the United States perceive and experience safety in MT projects, and 
how these perceptions compare to those in conventional concrete and steel construction. 
To achieve this objective, the data were collected through a national web-based survey 
of OSHA-authorized construction safety trainers. Analyses were conducted to explore 
perceptions of occupational safety in MT projects, to compare safety perceptions 
between MT and conventional materials, and to identify construction hazards and challenges 
specific to MT construction. Results show that respondents with MT experience generally 
perceive MT projects as safer than concrete or steel, whereas those without experience 
tend to be more neutral. However, even among experienced safety professionals in MT, 
a gap persists between observed and perceived safety hazards. High rates of near misses 
and non-fatal injuries further indicate operational strain during MT erection. These 
findings underscore the need for specialized, data-driven safety training and planning 
frameworks tailored to MT’s distinct workflows. Targeted safety programs can help align 
perception with reality, thereby improving safety outcomes in this rapidly expanding 
sustainable construction sector.

Structured Summary (Example):

- Research Problem:
  Occupational safety risks in mass timber construction are not well understood,
  especially compared to concrete and steel.

- Methods Used:
  A national web-based survey of OSHA-authorized safety trainers; descriptive
  statistics, chi-square tests, and Mann–Whitney U tests.

- Project Context / Setting:
  Mass timber projects across the U.S., reported by safety professionals with
  varying levels of MT experience.

- Key Findings:
  Safety professionals with MT experience generally perceive MT projects as safer
  than concrete or steel, while non-experienced respondents are more neutral.
  A gap exists between hazards actually witnessed (struck-by, falls from height,
  caught-in/between) and hazards perceived (fire, chemical exposure).

- Practical Implications for Construction Management:
  Mass timber requires safety training tailored to rigging, lifting, temporary
  stability, and environmental exposure. Stronger hazard-recognition training and
  near-miss reporting can close the perception gap and improve outcomes.
