FEW-SHOT EXAMPLE (using a published MT study)
------------------------------------------

Abstract (Example):
Mass timber construction (MTC) has emerged as a sustainable alternative... [abstract truncated for prompt length]

Structured Summary (Example):

- Research Problem:
  Occupational safety risks in mass timber construction are not well understood,
  especially compared to concrete and steel.

- Methods Used:
  A national web-based survey of OSHA-authorized safety trainers; descriptive
  statistics, chi-square tests, and Mann–Whitney U tests.

- Project Context / Setting:
  Mass timber projects across the U.S., reported by safety professionals with
  varying levels of MT experience.

- Key Findings:
  Safety professionals with MT experience generally perceive MT projects as safer
  than concrete or steel, while non-experienced respondents are more neutral.
  A gap exists between hazards actually witnessed (struck-by, falls from height,
  caught-in/between) and hazards perceived (fire, chemical exposure).

- Practical Implications for Construction Management:
  Mass timber requires safety training tailored to rigging, lifting, temporary
  stability, and environmental exposure. Stronger hazard-recognition training and
  near-miss reporting can close the perception gap and improve outcomes.
